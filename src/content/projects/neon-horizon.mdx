# Neon Horizon

This is a **personal project** exploring procedural generation in a high-speed racing context.

## The Challenge
Creating infinite tracks that are actually fun to drive on, not just random noise.

## The Solution
I implemented a spline-based generation system with "modules" of hand-crafted track segments that snap together based on difficulty curves.
